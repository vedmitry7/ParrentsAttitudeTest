    High scores on the "control" scale - 6-7 points - indicate that the adult person behaves too authoritatively towards the child, demanding unconditional obedience from him and asking him strict disciplinary frameworks. He imposes his will on the child in almost everything. Such an adult person can not always be useful, as a teacher, for children.
<p style = "text-indent: 5%;">
        Low scores on the same scale - 1-2 points - indicate that there is practically no control over the actions of the child from the adult side. This may not be good for teaching and raising children.

    The best estimate of the pedagogical abilities of an adult on this scale are the average scores, from 3 to 5 points.
