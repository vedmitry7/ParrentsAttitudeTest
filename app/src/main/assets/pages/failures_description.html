    High scores on the scale of "attitude to child failures" - 6-7 points - are a sign that an adult considers a child to be a small loser and treats him like an unintentional being. Interests, hobbies, thoughts and feelings of the child seem to the adult person to be frivolous, and he ignores them. It is unlikely that such an adult can become a good teacher and educator for the child.

    Low scores on the same scale - 1-2 points, on the contrary, indicate that the adult considers the failure of the child to be accidental and believes in it. Such an adult, most likely, will become a good teacher and educator.</body>
