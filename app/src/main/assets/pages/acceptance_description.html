    High scores on the scale "acceptance - rejection" - from 24 to 33 - indicate that the adult has a pronounced positive attitude towards the child. The adult in this case accepts the child as he is, respects and recognizes his personality, approves his interests, supports plans, spends quite a lot of time with him and does not regret about it.
<p style = "text-indent: 5%;">
        Low scores on the same scale - from 0 to 8 - indicate that the adult experiences only negative feelings towards the child: irritation, anger, annoyance, even sometimes hatred. Such an adult considers a child a failure, does not believe in his future, lowly estimates his abilities, and often treats his child with his attitude. This adult can not be a good teacher.
